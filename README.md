# Jekyll Theme Unit Test

I found myself creating *dummy* content over and over again to test Jekyll themes against. So to save time I put together a collection of posts, pages, and collections that cover all sorts of edge cases one might encounter.

This was predominately built to test [my Jekyll themes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) so there are a few layout specific tests in there. But otherwise it should be a solid starting point to test your project against.

## Usage

Simply copy the files into your project and assign `layout: ` as a [Front Matter default](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults). Layouts haven't been assigned to make things more flexible as everyone names them differently.

**Examples:**

```yaml
defaults:
  
  # all posts
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      read_time: true
      comments: true
      share: true
      related: true

  # all _pages
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: pages
    values:
      layout: single

  # recipes collection
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: recipes
    values:
      layout: single
  
  # pets collection
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: pets
    values:
      layout: single

  # portfolio collection
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: portfolio
    values:
      layout: single
```

## Sample Content

| Name | Description | Layout Dependent |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **authors** | `authors.yml` data file for testing multi-author sites | Yes |
| **drafts** | sample draft posts | No |
| **includes** | various helpers for generating galleries, feature blocks, table of contents, etc. | Yes |
| **pages** | sample pages, 404 error page, and various Liquid-based archives | No |
| **collections** | collection documents for `_pets`, `_recipes`, `_portfolio` | No |
| **posts** | sample posts with a range of content and edge-cases | Yes |
| **images** | image assets found in sample posts and collections | No |

Some archives make use of the [`group-by-array`](https://github.com/mushishi78/jekyll-group-by-array) include helper.
